# dotNet Intro 1

A simple Windows form application with an externally referenced classlibrary in C#

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the Visual Studio Solution, containing 2 projects.
'BaseMath' is a classlibrary, containing the 4 basic mathematic functions (add, sub, multiply, divide).
'FormIntro' is the windows form application which references the BaseMath classlibary. This solution is created
simply to demonstrate my coding style.

### Prerequisites

Open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2017 or later and build the solution.
